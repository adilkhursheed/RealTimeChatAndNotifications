# RealTimeChatAndNotifications
A simple Real Time Chat and Notifications Implementation using SignalR.</br>
In this branch (dev-helloworld) there is one hub and three clients as below.</br></br>
1 - Web JS/HTML client, this app sends and receives the messages.</br>
2 - WebAPI, Using HubContext in the same project we have registered the hub. We have only created a Send message API.</br>
3 - Console App, which uses SignalR.Client and subscribed for the notifications.</br></br>

Its very simple and helpfull for getting started. below is an illustration.</br>
